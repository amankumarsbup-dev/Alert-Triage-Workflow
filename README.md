Problem Statement-
Security teams at cloud-native organizations receive hundreds of alerts daily from AWS, Azure, and GCP. Critical threats get buried in noise, investigations lack standardization, and valuable time is lost switching between multiple tools to gather context.

Overview
A fully functional prototype demonstrating how security engineers can efficiently investigate and resolve cloud security alerts. This application addresses critical challenges in Security Operations Centers (SOC): alert fatigue, inconsistent investigations, and slow response times.

The Solution
This workflow consolidates all investigation context into a single interface, guiding security engineers through triage, investigation, and remediation with:

Intelligent Prioritization: Risk scoring algorithm combines severity, indicators, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics
Contextual Investigation: All resource details, detection rules, and related alerts in one view

Design Approach
Built with security engineers in mind, focusing on reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) from ~4 hours to under 2 hours for critical alerts. The design prioritizes speed over complexity, context over clicks, and provides guidance without being prescriptive.
